    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    
    <section id="wec-pro-faq">
      
      <h2>1) What is WEC-Pro?</h2>
      <p>
        WEC-Pro is a research project dedicated to advancing the commercial viability of <strong>Wave Energy Converters (WECs)</strong>. The project addresses the current barriers in the sector by integrating numerical modeling with <strong>Large-Scale Additive Manufacturing (LSAM)</strong>. By leveraging the expertise of partners like Politecnico di Torino and Caracol, WEC-Pro aims to streamline the design, production, and testing phases of marine energy devices, bridging the gap between theoretical optimization and industrial application.
      </p>

      <h2>2) Why is wave energy important?</h2>
      <p>
        Ocean waves represent a massive, untapped global resource estimated at approximately <strong>32 PWh/year</strong>. Unlike other renewable sources, waves offer high energy density and greater predictability. Harnessing this resource can significantly expand the European renewable energy portfolio, reduce land usage requirements, and strengthen energy security by complementing the intermittency of wind and solar power.
      </p>

      <h2>3) What are today’s main challenges in the sector?</h2>
      <p>
        The wave energy sector currently faces a "high-cost, low-readiness" cycle. Traditional manufacturing processes are complex and expensive, and design methods borrowed from naval engineering are often not tailored to the specific needs of energy absorption. These factors contribute to high development costs and low Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), hindering the commercial scalability of devices.
      </p>

      <h2>4) How does LSAM (Large-Scale Additive Manufacturing) help?</h2>
      <p>
        LSAM transforms the production landscape by enabling the rapid manufacturing of complex, hydrodynamically optimized geometries that are difficult to achieve with standard molds. This technology reduces material waste and allows for the use of sustainable materials. Crucially, when coupled with adapted optimization tools, LSAM has the potential to reduce the cost of devices by over <strong>10 times</strong> compared to traditional methods.
      </p>

      <h2>5) What are WEC-Pro’s specific goals?</h2>
      <p>
        The project's primary goal is to upgrade established design methods by integrating LSAM manufacturing constraints directly into the modeling tools. WEC-Pro focuses on three main work packages: multi-parameter performance design, structural optimization, and physical testing. The project aims to validate these methods by producing and testing a fully 3D-printed physical model of a point absorber WEC for offshore application.
      </p>

      <h2>6) Who is involved in the project?</h2>
      <p>
        WEC-Pro is a collaborative effort leveraging distinct areas of expertise. It is hosted at <strong>Politecnico di Torino (POLITO)</strong>, which provides strong expertise in WEC optimization. <strong>Caracol</strong>, Europe’s principal LSAM production center, leads the manufacturing innovations. Additionally, the project involves testing at specialized national laboratory to validate the physical model in fully operational environment.
      </p>

      <h2>7) What impact is expected?</h2>
      <p>
        The project aims to deliver open-source tools and models for WEC power absorption and structural optimization, alongside valuable data sets for benchmarking LSAM-produced devices. Societally, it will raise awareness of ocean energy through outreach. Economically, it establishes a pipeline for collaborative R&D and supports the EU's renewable energy production targets.
      </p>

      <h2>8) How does WEC-Pro align with EU priorities?</h2>
      <p>
        WEC-Pro directly supports the European Green Deal and REPowerEU initiatives by unlocking a new blue economy sector. It advances key Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically <strong>SDG 7</strong> (Affordable and Clean Energy), <strong>SDG 9</strong> (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), and <strong>SDG 13</strong> (Climate Action), by fostering a sustainable and fast manufacturing route for renewable energy technology.
